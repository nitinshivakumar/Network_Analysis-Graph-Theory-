# Exploring Social Network Structure and Community Detection in the Karate Club

## Objective:
This project aims to analyze the social network structure of a karate club using network analysis techniques provided by the networkx library in Python. The code focuses on visualizing the network, calculating various network metrics, detecting communities within the club, and displaying the results through visualizations.

## Tools and Libraries Used:

Python: The programming language used for the project.
networkx: A Python library used for the analysis and visualization of complex networks.
matplotlib: A Python library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
Project Steps:

## Importing Libraries and Data:
Import the necessary libraries (networkx and matplotlib).
Load the karate club graph using the karate_club_graph function from networkx.
Visualizing the Network:
Utilize the circular layout to display the karate club network.
Highlight key nodes (Mr. Hi and John A) by assigning different colors.
Calculate and display the edge density of the network.
Degree Distribution Analysis:
Calculate the degree of each node using the degree function in networkx.
Compute the average degree of the network.
Create a histogram of the degree distribution and mark the average degree.
Local Clustering Coefficient Analysis:
Calculate the local clustering coefficient for each node using networkx.
Compute the average local clustering coefficient.
Create a histogram of the local clustering coefficient distribution and mark the average.
Community Detection:
Apply the greedy modularity community detection algorithm using greedy_modularity_communities from networkx.
Determine the number of detected communities.
Display the nodes belonging to each community in different colors.
Visualization of Communities:
Plot the network again, this time highlighting different communities using distinct colors.
Display the detected communities along with node labels indicating the final club each member joined.

# Project Outcome:
The project provides insights into the social structure of the karate club through network analysis. It visualizes the network, analyzes degree distribution and local clustering coefficients, detects distinct communities within the club, and presents the findings through various visualizations. The project helps demonstrate how network analysis techniques can reveal meaningful patterns in social networks and aid in understanding community structures.
